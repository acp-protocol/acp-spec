**Message Template:**

```
I'm excited to share the AI Context Protocol (ACP) - an open standard for embedding machine-readable context in codebases for AI-assisted development.

ACP helps AI tools understand your code structure, respect your constraints, and navigate your codebase efficiently.

Key features:
• Structured annotations (@acp:module, @acp:domain, @acp:lock)
• Constraint system (frozen, restricted, approval-required)
• Token-efficient variables
• Pre-computed cache for fast queries
• Works with any AI tool (Claude, GPT, Copilot, Cursor)
