This project uses ACP (AI Context Protocol). Codebase metadata is cached and queryable via CLI—do not scan files directly.

You MUST run this BEFORE editing ANY file:
  acp constraints <path>

Constraint levels (from output):
  frozen → DO NOT modify under any circumstances
  restricted → explain proposed changes, wait for user approval before proceeding
  normal → safe to modify

File annotations: @acp:lock, @acp:ref <url>, @acp:style <guide>, @acp:hack
