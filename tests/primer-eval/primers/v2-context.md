description: Explains what ACP caches
tags: [context, moderate]
---

This project uses ACP (AI Context Protocol)—a structured cache of codebase metadata (symbols, constraints, call graphs, domains) queryable via CLI instead of scanning files.

BEFORE editing any file: acp constraints <path>
To explore: acp query symbol|file|domain|callers <n>
To learn more: acp knowledge "question"
